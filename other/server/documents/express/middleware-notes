In Express.js, the `.use()` method is a way to mount middleware functions at a specified path. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle, commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

When you call `app.use()`, you're telling Express to use the specified middleware function(s) for every HTTP request that comes into your application, or for specific routes if you provide a path as the first argument.

In the code you've shown:

1. `app.use(cors());`
   This applies the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware to all routes. It allows your server to respond to requests from different origins (domains).

2. `app.use(express.json());`
   This applies the built-in Express middleware for parsing JSON payloads in incoming requests. It allows you to access the parsed data in `req.body` for requests with JSON content.

These middleware functions are executed in the order they are declared. So in this case, for every incoming request, Express will first handle CORS, then parse any JSON in the request body, before passing control to any route handlers.

The `.use()` method is very flexible. You can use it to:
- Apply middleware to all routes
- Apply middleware to specific routes
- Chain multiple middleware functions
- Mount sub-applications

It's a fundamental part of how Express handles requests and organizes application logic.

Additional middleware:
- `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`
  This middleware parses incoming requests with urlencoded payloads (form data) and adds the parsed data to `req.body`.

- `app.use(morgan('dev'));`
  This middleware logs HTTP requests and responses. It's useful for debugging and monitoring.

- `app.use(helmet());`
  This middleware sets various HTTP headers to improve security.
